# Service–Operations–Collaborators

HireAssist · service decomposition per **ADR-001**, as amended by **ADR-006** — 5 services + 1 API
Gateway. **Every collaboration is REST over HTTP/JSON** (ADR-001) — there is no second protocol
and no message broker, so the protocol is not marked per row.

**API Gateway** is the entry point, not a domain service. It terminates TLS, routes, rate-limits,
resolves the caller's role, and validates the session by calling
`Identity Service.validateSession()`. It rejects any request exceeding the caller's role and
calls `Compliance & Insights Service.recordAuthorisationRejected()` for the access audit log. It
owns no data.

**External systems**, each behind an adapter: Object / Blob Storage, LLM Provider (reached only by
AI Service), Email Provider. PDF text extraction is an in-process library in Resume Processing,
not an external service — a scanned image with no text layer is a permanent failure by design
(FR-2.7), not something to send to an OCR provider.

No service reads another service's data store. Every crossing is one of the operations above,
called over REST.

## Notes on five collaborations

**Hiring owns the criteria; the snapshot travels with the handover.** Criteria belong to the Job
Opening, created in UC-1 and held by Hiring. `submitResumeForScreening()` carries a snapshot of
them in its body, and Resume Processing stores it on the work row for the life of that entry —
it never calls back to fetch criteria, and it is not their owner. Two reasons: a fetch per resume
puts a synchronous dependency on Hiring in the middle of the path built to have none, and
criteria can be edited while a batch runs — a snapshot pins one version to one resume, so every
justification is defensible against the criteria actually used (NFR-15).

**Screening is asynchronous even though the call is REST.** `submitResumeForScreening()` returns
as soon as the work row is durably written, not when the resume is scored; Resume Processing
calls `reportScreeningResult()` back when it has an answer. The queue is a table inside Resume
Processing (ADR-002), not infrastructure between the two services.

**Hiring reads the profile, it does not copy it.** Two main flows need candidate data Hiring does
not own: generating an interview guide (UC-3) needs the profile, and opening a screened candidate
needs the written justification. Both are AI-derived documents in Resume Processing's store, so
Hiring calls `getCandidateProfile()` for them at read time.

The alternative — carrying the justification back inside `reportScreeningResult()` and storing it
in Hiring — was rejected. It would put an AI-derived document in the relational system of record,
which is exactly the boundary ADR-003 draws to keep anonymisation coarse: *drop the documents,
keep the counts*. A justification duplicated into Hiring is a second place a person's data must be
erased from, and a second copy that can disagree with the first. The ranked list itself is
unaffected either way — score and must-have check are Hiring's own columns, so the list never
waits on a document read (NFR-03). Only opening an individual candidate does.

**Profile extraction is deterministic, not a model call.** Resume Processing parses the PDF into a
normalised profile in-process, then calls the model only to score it. ADR-004 defines exactly three
model operations, and none of them is field extraction.

**The dashboard is a projection, not a query.** Compliance & Insights maintains its own view of
open positions from the `recordPipelineEvent()` calls Hiring makes as things happen, and does not
call `getJobOpening()` to build it. ADR-001 records that metrics span services and must be
maintained incrementally.

## Open decisions this table touches

Recorded here so they are not settled by implementation:

- **Erasure is orchestrated.** Compliance & Insights calls `eraseHiringData()` and
  `eraseCandidateProfile()` and tracks completion. That is a real answer to the erasure-cascade
  question — orchestration over choreography — and it needs an ADR before it is built.
- **The candidate register sits in Resume Processing**, alongside the profile, rather than being
  split from it. Also unrecorded.
- **Pipeline events are pushed, not published.** With no broker, Hiring calls
  `recordPipelineEvent()` directly, which makes Compliance a synchronous dependency of Hiring's
  write path and gives a lost call no retry story. Needs an ADR before it is built.
- **Interview guides are owned by Hiring but are AI-derived documents.** ADR-003 places such
  documents in MongoDB, which is otherwise Resume Processing's store, so Hiring needs a document
  store of its own.
