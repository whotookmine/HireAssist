# Architecture Decision Records

Each significant architectural decision is recorded here using
[TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md), which follows the **Jeff Tyree & Art Akerman** decision record
template from the course slides — grouped as *Summary · Details · Related · Notes*, with
optional fields marked in the template.

The course requires **at least 3 ADRs** as part of the project proposal submission.

## Index

| ID | Decision | Status | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| [ADR-001](ADR-001-service-decomposition.md) | Capability-aligned service decomposition behind an API gateway | Accepted | 2026-09-11 |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-async-screening-pipeline.md) | One independently retried unit of work per resume, held in a claimable work table | Accepted | 2026-09-11 |
| [ADR-003](ADR-003-polyglot-persistence.md) | PostgreSQL as system of record, MongoDB for AI-derived documents | Accepted | 2026-09-11 |
| [ADR-004](ADR-004-llm-access.md) | All model access through one AI Service, on a managed API that does not train on our data | Accepted | 2026-09-11 |
| [ADR-005](ADR-005-per-service-language.md) | Each service chooses its own language and framework, within shared contracts | **Proposed** | 2026-09-11 |
| [ADR-006](ADR-006-single-tenant-deployment.md) | One deployment per customer company | Accepted | 2026-09-11 |
| [ADR-007](ADR-007-grpc-for-the-ai-service.md) | gRPC on the AI Service boundary | Accepted | 2026-09-20 |
| [ADR-008](ADR-008-profile-extraction-is-a-model-call.md) | Turning a resume into a candidate profile is a model call | Accepted | 2026-10-01 |
| [ADR-009](ADR-009-jwt-with-refresh-tokens.md) | Short-lived JWT access tokens with rotating refresh tokens | **Proposed** | 2026-09-24 |

The four are best read in order: ADR-001 draws the boundaries, ADR-002 fills in the busiest one,
ADR-003 says what each side stores, and ADR-004 fills in the dependency the others are built to
survive. ADR-002 and ADR-004 are a deliberate pair — running without a fallback model is only
acceptable because no accepted work is lost (NFR-10).

Five candidates identified on 2026-09-11 have since been answered and removed from the list
below, which now holds eleven — two of them raised by ADR-008. The five answered were: the
model-provider question by ADR-004; work-queue topology, worker scaling and delivery guarantee by
ADR-002; the scorer boundary by ADR-001 and ADR-004, with per-criterion evidence persistence by
ADR-003; service discovery by ADR-001; and the datastore split by ADR-003.

## What later records have changed

The ADRs are a stack: an earlier record is never edited because of a later one, so each states
what was decided on its date and nothing after. This section is the living view — it is the only
place that tracks which parts of an earlier record no longer hold.

| Record | Still in force | Changed by a later record |
|---|---|---|
| **ADR-001** | The five services, the capability boundaries, the gateway, Kubernetes discovery, and REST on every boundary **except the AI Service**. | The single-backend-language assumption is withdrawn (ADR-005). The workspace concept is gone (ADR-006): the isolation force in *Issue*, the gateway's workspace resolution, the internal-call cost, and the *Identity & Workspace* name. The AI Service boundary is gRPC, not REST (ADR-007); the rule stands everywhere else. Its argument that Resume Processing and the AI Service have opposite resource profiles no longer holds — both now wait on a model call (ADR-008); the boundary stands on failure isolation and credential containment. |
| **ADR-002** | All of it. | — |
| **ADR-003** | The PostgreSQL / MongoDB split and the rule that decides which store new data goes in. | Documents carry `candidate_id` alone, with no `workspace_id` (ADR-006). |
| **ADR-004** | The single credential, no fallback model, the service being unreachable from the gateway, and the rule that it never receives a raw file. | Those operations are carried over gRPC rather than REST (ADR-007). There are now four, not three: profile extraction is a model call served here (ADR-008), and it is the one operation that receives unstructured resume text, which narrows the minimisation rule and moves the protected-attribute stripping into it. |
| **ADR-005** | The principle and the guardrails. Still *Proposed* — languages await service ownership. | The worst case its access-check argument guards against is now a privilege mistake inside one company, not a cross-company leak (ADR-006). Its contract guardrail now covers two mechanisms: OpenAPI for REST boundaries, a `.proto` for the AI Service (ADR-007). Its Python preference for Resume Processing now rests on PDF text extraction alone — structuring the text is no longer done there (ADR-008). |
| **ADR-006** | All of it. | — |
| **ADR-007** | All of it. | — |
| **ADR-008** | All of it. | — |

## Candidate decisions

Identified from the architecturally significant requirements in
[../NON-FUNCTIONAL-REQUIREMENTS.md](../NON-FUNCTIONAL-REQUIREMENTS.md) and from open questions in
[../CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md).

| Decision | Forced by |
|---|---|
| Tiered screening pipeline — deterministic filter before the model? | NFR-02, NFR-06, NFR-08 |
| Rule-based pre-pass in front of profile extraction, once cost per batch is measured | ADR-008 |
| Character recognition for scanned resumes, which neither extraction path handles | ADR-008 |
| Erasure cascade — orchestration or choreography, and how the verification pass works across the two stores ADR-003 introduced | FR-5.3, FR-5.8, NFR-13 |
| Resume ingestion channel — upload only, or an automated adapter | Open question |
| Front-end framework and the shape of the recruiter-facing web application | Course requirement (UI for demonstration), NFR-16 |
| Session and token mechanism for UC-0 | FR-0.1, FR-0.2, FR-0.4 |
| Deployment and upgrade pipeline for N customer instances | ADR-006 |
| Scheduler shared by UC-4 and UC-5 — where the timer runs, behaviour with more than one replica, resuming a sweep that dies half-way | FR-4.2, FR-5.2 |
| Repository structure once implementation starts — monorepo layout, and where the shared OpenAPI definitions live | Open question, ADR-005 |
| Primary and secondary owner for each service | ADR-005 rule 5 |

## Conventions

- File name: `ADR-NNN-short-slug.md`, numbered sequentially from `001`.
- Numbers are never reused, even if an ADR is superseded or withdrawn.
- Superseding an ADR does not edit the original in any way, its status included. Write a new
  record stating what it replaces, and note it in *What later records have changed* above.
- Add a row to the index in the same commit that adds the ADR.
