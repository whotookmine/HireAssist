"""Build a short Word proposal.

Project Name, Problem Description, Target Customers, Scenario (use-case &
description), Functional Requirements, Non-functional Requirements — the
brief's headings, in the brief's order.

The prose sections are a condensation of PROPOSAL.md, not a conversion — the
proposal is written to be complete, this is written to be read in one sitting.
PROPOSAL.md stays the source of truth; when the two disagree, it wins.

The requirements are the exception: they are parsed out of
FUNCTIONAL-REQUIREMENTS.md and NON-FUNCTIONAL-REQUIREMENTS.md verbatim, so
they cannot drift from the documents that own them. Editing a requirement here
would be editing it in the wrong place.
