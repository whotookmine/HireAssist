# System Overview

How HireAssist behaves at runtime: what each service holds, who calls whom, and the sequence of
calls behind each use case.

**This document is the runtime view, and it is not the source of truth for anything.** It defers
to three documents and must be corrected whenever any of them changes:

| For | See |
|---|---|
| The full operation list per service, and every collaboration | [SERVICE-OPERATIONS-COLLABORATORS.md](SERVICE-OPERATIONS-COLLABORATORS.md) |
| Use case descriptions, actors, main and alternate flows | [PROPOSAL.md](PROPOSAL.md) |
| Why any of this is shaped the way it is | [adr/](adr/) |

Every call below is **REST over HTTP/JSON**. There is no gRPC and no message broker
([ADR-001](adr/ADR-001-service-decomposition.md), [ADR-002](adr/ADR-002-async-screening-pipeline.md)).

## The six services

### API Gateway

- **Owns** — nothing. No schema, no store.
- **Does** — terminates TLS, validates the session token, resolves the caller's role, rate-limits,
  routes. Rejects any request exceeding the caller's role.
- **Called by** — the recruiter-facing web application. The only public entry point for user
  traffic; the System Scheduler is an internal trigger and does not pass through it.
- **Calls** — `Identity.validateSession()` on every request; `Compliance.recordAuthorisationRejected()`
  on every rejection; routes onward to Identity, Hiring, Compliance and Resume Processing. Never
  the AI Service.

### Identity Service

- **Owns** — PostgreSQL: accounts, memberships, roles, sessions.
- **Does** — authenticates a member, issues and validates sessions, answers what role a caller
  holds, and lets an Admin create, remove and re-role recruiters.
- **Called by** — the Gateway, on every request.
- **Calls** — nothing. It is the only service with no downstream at all, which is what makes it
  safe to place on the hot path of every request.

### Hiring Service

- **Owns** — PostgreSQL: job openings, criteria, screening batches and per-entry status, scores,
  overrides, shortlist decisions. MongoDB: interview guides. *(That document store is an open
  decision — [ADR-003](adr/ADR-003-polyglot-persistence.md) places AI-derived documents in
  MongoDB, which is otherwise Resume Processing's store.)*
- **Does** — holds the entire recruiter-facing hiring record: openings and their criteria, batch
  acceptance and per-resume handover, the ranked list, overrides, shortlisting, interview guides.
- **Called by** — the Gateway; Resume Processing, calling `reportScreeningResult()` back;
  Compliance, calling `eraseHiringData()`.
- **Calls** — Resume Processing (`submitResumeForScreening()`, `getCandidateProfile()`); the AI
  Service (`deriveCriteriaFromDescription()`, `generateInterviewQuestions()`);
  `Compliance.recordPipelineEvent()`; the Object Storage and Email adapters.

### Resume Processing Service

- **Owns** — PostgreSQL: the screening work table, candidate identity, the date the data was
  collected. MongoDB: candidate profiles, parsed resume text, per-criterion scoring output and
  justifications.
- **Does** — the per-resume pipeline. Records a handover durably and acknowledges immediately;
  N replicas claim work rows with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; each parses the PDF in
  process, calls the model to score it, persists, and calls back. Classifies permanent against
  transient failure, backs off, and parks what will not recover. **This is the service that
  scales** — NFR-07, the demonstrated quality attribute, is delivered here.
- **Called by** — Hiring, for the handover and for profile reads; Compliance, for erasure and
  listing; the Gateway, for recruiter-facing reads. *(How those reads are routed is not yet
  stated — see Open questions.)*
- **Calls** — `AI.scoreAgainstCriteria()`; `Hiring.reportScreeningResult()`; the Object Storage
  adapter.

### AI Service

- **Owns** — no domain data. Prompts as configuration, the model credential as a secret.
- **Does** — the only place a model is ever called. Three operations, expressed in domain terms
  rather than model terms. Owns the token budget and rate limits, strips protected attributes
  before a prompt is built, and records the model version with every answer.
- **Called by** — Hiring and Resume Processing only. Not reachable through the Gateway.
- **Calls** — the LLM adapter, to the managed provider. Nothing else.

### Compliance & Insights Service

- **Owns** — PostgreSQL: the retention policy, pipeline metrics, the erasure audit log (which
  names a candidate only by a pseudonymous identifier), and the access audit log.
- **Does** — the clock-driven, destructive half of the system: retention sweeps, erasure
  orchestrated across the services that hold the data and proved afterwards, staleness flagging,
  and the dashboard maintained as a projection rather than computed as a query.
- **Called by** — the Gateway; Hiring, pushing `recordPipelineEvent()`; the Gateway again, pushing
  `recordAuthorisationRejected()`; the System Scheduler.
- **Calls** — `Hiring.eraseHiringData()`; Resume Processing (`eraseCandidateProfile()`,
  `listCandidateProfiles()`); the Email adapter.

## Request flows

### UC-0 — Sign in

```
Browser → Gateway → Identity.authenticateMember()
                  ← session token
```

Every later request passes `Gateway → Identity.validateSession()`, which resolves the role before
the request is routed. A request above the caller's role stops at the Gateway, which calls
`Compliance.recordAuthorisationRejected()` for the access audit log.

### UC-1 — Create a job opening

```
Browser → Gateway → Hiring.createJobOpening()
                    Hiring  → AI.deriveCriteriaFromDescription() → LLM provider
                            ← proposed title and weighted criteria
                    [Recruiter reviews and edits — the correction point]
                    Hiring  writes the opening and its criteria to PostgreSQL
                    Hiring  → Compliance.recordPipelineEvent()
```

The review step is where a human corrects the model, before any resume has been scored against a
wrong criterion.

### UC-2 — Batch-screen resumes

Two halves. The first must return within two seconds (NFR-04); the second takes minutes.

**Accepting the batch**

```
Browser → Gateway → Hiring.submitScreeningBatch()
                    Hiring → ObjectStorage.storeResumeFile()          × N
                    Hiring writes the batch and one pending entry per resume
                    Hiring → ResumeProcessing.submitResumeForScreening()   × N
                             (batch id, resume id, file key, CRITERIA SNAPSHOT)
                           ← acknowledged once the work row is committed
                  ← batch id
```

The criteria snapshot travels in the request body. Resume Processing never calls back to fetch
criteria: that would add a synchronous dependency to the path built to have none, and a snapshot
pins one criteria version to one resume, so a mid-batch edit cannot invalidate a justification
already written.

**Screening each resume** — N replicas, working independently

```
worker claims a work row (SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)
   → ObjectStorage.fetchResumeFile()
   → parse the PDF in process                 ← deterministic, not a model call
   → AI.scoreAgainstCriteria() → LLM provider
   → persist the profile and the scoring output
   → Hiring.reportScreeningResult()           ← upsert on (batch_id, resume_id)
   → result streams to the ranked list
```

A **permanent** failure — a corrupt file, a scanned image with no text layer — is never retried;
the entry becomes *needs manual review* with the reason. A **transient** failure — 429, 5xx, a
broken connection, a scoring attempt past its 60-second bound — backs off and retries a bounded
number of times, then goes to a terminal failed state. A batch is complete when every entry is
terminal, which triggers the batch-finished notification.

**Reviewing the results**

```
Browser → Gateway → Hiring.getRankedResults()          ← Hiring's own columns, no document read
        opening one candidate:
                    Hiring → ResumeProcessing.getCandidateProfile()   ← the justification
        then        Hiring.overrideScore() · Hiring.shortlistCandidate()
```

### UC-3 — Generate interview questions

```
Browser → Gateway → Hiring.generateInterviewGuide()
                    Hiring → ResumeProcessing.getCandidateProfile()
                    Hiring → AI.generateInterviewQuestions() → LLM provider
                           ← questions, each tagged with the criterion it tests
                             and the resume evidence it came from
                    Hiring retains the guide
```

### UC-4 — Monitor pipeline and stale positions

```
Recruiter:   Browser   → Gateway → Compliance.getPipelineDashboard()
                                   served from Compliance's own counters
Scheduler:   Scheduler → Compliance.evaluateStaleness()
                         flags openings past their expected time-to-fill
                         → Email adapter → the responsible Recruiter
```

Paused openings are excluded from evaluation, so the alerts stay meaningful.

### UC-5 — Enforce candidate data retention

```
Admin:       Browser   → Gateway → Compliance.setRetentionPolicy()
Scheduler:   Scheduler → Compliance.evaluateRetention()
                         warning window  → Email adapter
                         on expiry, orchestrates erasure:
                            → Hiring.eraseHiringData()
                            → ResumeProcessing.eraseCandidateProfile()
                            → the resume file in object storage
                         writes the erasure audit entry (pseudonymous identifier only)
```

A candidate in an active hiring process has expiry held for a Recruiter to resolve. An erasure
that fails is reported as *deletion pending* and retried — never as erased.

### UC-6 — Manage recruiter accounts

```
Admin → Gateway → Identity.createMember() · removeMember() · changeMemberRole()
```

## Open questions this view exposes

Both are recorded elsewhere; they are repeated here because the runtime view is where they show.

- **Who routes Resume Processing's recruiter-facing reads.** `listUnparsableResumes()` and
  `getCandidateProfile()` are things a Recruiter looks at, but nothing states whether the Gateway
  routes to Resume Processing directly or Hiring proxies. See [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md).
- **`recordPipelineEvent()` is a synchronous dependency** in Hiring's write path, and a dropped
  call leaves a permanently wrong dashboard number with nothing to reconcile against. It is the
  first place a message broker would earn its keep. See
  [SERVICE-OPERATIONS-COLLABORATORS.md](SERVICE-OPERATIONS-COLLABORATORS.md).
